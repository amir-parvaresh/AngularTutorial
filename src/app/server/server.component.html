<!--Here we use attribute directives, meaning that these wont add or remove any elements, but only change the element-->
<!-- Also the [] is not part of the directive, it is only an attribute binder -->
<!-- ngStyle allows to dynamically update the styles -->
<!-- for String interpolation, only the functions should be called that return strings-->
